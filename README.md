# theAmalgam
An amalgamation of scripts I've produced that need to be tested as working in their exe format


# Files List & Descriptions
## mainTXTv2 // txtReader
txtReader is somewhat self-explanatory, it can read text files in the txt format and output them to the terminal (The termianl being the mainTXTv2.exe window).
It can read files in the same directory as the exe, but it's untested whether it can read files outside of its directory.
txtReader also displays a history of recently read text files.

### Try this.
Try specifying the location of the text file you want to read in its name when using txtReader, i.e: if the exe is located in C://Downloads/directory, try 'C://anotherDirectory/name.txt'.
Also try using a single forward slash (/) after typing 'C:'.
And replacing forward slashes (/) with back slashes (\).
If it doesn't work, try running the program in administrator mode and try again.

## numGuesser
numGuesser is also pretty self-explanatory, the CPU will think of a number from 1-10, and you have to guess it in as little attempts as possible.
